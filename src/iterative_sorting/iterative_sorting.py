# Selection Sort 
# 1- select the smallest element in the collection,swap with the first element
# 2- Repeat the process with the 2nd smallest, 3rd smallest, etc.
# You will need to pass

# TO-DO:  implement the Bubble Sort function below
# Start at beginning and compare each element to its right hand neighbor. 
# If the right hand neighbor is smaller, we swap the two neighbors.
# The above process is repeated until we pass through the entire collection without performing a single swap. 
# With each pass, the larger elements will “bubble” toward the right hand side of the collection.
